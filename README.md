# Hi there, I'm JehÃº Frayle ðŸ‘‹

You can call me JehÃº (pronounced however you can). I'm a web developer with interests in both front-end and back-end development. I'm also passionate about cybersecurity ðŸ”’, data science ðŸ“Š, hardware ðŸ’» and everything involved with technology and how it works.

### What I'm up to ðŸŒ±

#### Web Development
I'm currently learning **Next.js** but I really like **Angular**. I have experience with vanilla **JavaScript** and have completed a few projects using it. I also like **TypeScript** and am currently learning **C#**.

#### C# and .NET 
I have worked on several university projects using **C#** and **.NET**. I also had the opportunity to work on a project refactoring .NET code and SQL queries for a few months. I am very comfortable programming in this language and always looking for new ways to improve my skills.

#### Game Development
I also have a passion for game development using **Godot**. I have been using it for a while now and have completed a few small games with it. I like Godot because I enjoy using open source software and I also love playing indie games on platforms like **itch.io**. I hope to create my own indie games someday and continue learning new techniques and approaches to game development.

#### Linux
I also have experience with Linux and enjoy learning about its various distributions and command-line interface. I have used it extensively both as a development environment and as a daily driver. However, due to some circumstances, I had to switch to Windows recently, which is unfortunate, but I am still comfortable with using it.

### Hardware 

My first foray into coding was through programming **Arduino**, and I still enjoy working on personal projects with Arduino and other platforms like **Raspberry Pi**. I find it incredibly satisfying to see my code bring physical components to life...
