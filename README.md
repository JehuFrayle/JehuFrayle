# Hi there, I'm JehÃº Frayle ðŸ‘‹

You can call me JehÃº (pronounced however you can). I'm a web developer with interests in both front-end and back-end development. I'm also passionate about cybersecurity ðŸ”’, data science ðŸ“Š, hardware ðŸ’» and everything involved with technology and how it works.

## What I'm up to ðŸŒ±

I'm currently learning **Next.js** but I really like **Angular** . I have experience with vanilla **JavaScript** and have completed a few projects using it. I also like **TypeScript** and am currently learning **C#**.
